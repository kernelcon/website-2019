    "description": "Hack your career.  Whether you’re just starting out professionally in security, or looking to change things up the Kernelcon resume clinic is the perfect place to get constructive, honest advice on your resume and interviewing skills. First, experienced recruitment volunteers will review your resume and give you constructive feedback on how to get beyond corporate filters and non-technical reviewers.  Next, a brief one-on-one interview with an experienced security hiring manager will give you a sandbox for testing your interviewing techniques.  After the interview, the hiring manager will discuss with you the details of your resume, skills, and interview and including areas to focus on for improvement. The Kernelcon resume clinic is a pressure-free environment, and your information won’t be given to any of the recruiters involved unless you provide it.  The clinic is free for attendees, but space is limited and slots will be filled on a first-come first-serve basis. Talent & Employers, Kernelcon is happy to provide job hiring/seeking bracelets.  If you’re looking to hire some of the best hackers in the area, or you are scoping out new opportunities grab a bracelet from the registration table.  Spark up a conversation with others who have the bracelet and see where it takes you.",
