    "question": "Is there an Internet Connection at Kernelcon?",
    "answer": "Of course! How else are you going to be able to post pics of all the fun at Kernelcon to IG? We aim to provide a robust and highly capable wireless network. You should consider it semi-hostile. Make sure you use appropriate VPN or other secure methods of communication because it is a security conference after all, and we’re sure people are listening."

    "question": "I want to submit a talk, does it have to be about kernels?",
    "answer": "No, but we smile when talks include core parts of a operating system, a softer typically edible part of a nut, cereal, grain, fruit, corn, a convolution matrix, classes of algorithms like SVM, or an unmarked linguistic string."
  },
  {
    "question": "Are talks streamed or recorded?",
    "answer": "There are currently no plans for this."
  },
  {
    "question": "I can't or don't want to register online (technical issue, privacy issue, etc), can I still attend?",
    "answer": "Yes!  If you have an issue but still want to register early, please contact us at info@kernelcon.org.  We will be accepting cash at the door.  Keep in mind that registering early guarantees you swag, that clothing is appropriate size, that workshops you want aren't full, etc."
